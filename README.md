# Retail Sales EDA 📊

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on retail sales data to uncover insights and trends. The goal is to help businesses make data-driven decisions by identifying sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance.

## 📂 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains transactional records of a retail business with the following columns:
- **Transaction ID** – Unique identifier for each transaction
- **Date** – Date of the transaction
- **Customer ID** – Unique identifier for each customer
- **Gender** – Customer gender (Male/Female)
- **Age** – Customer age
- **Product Category** – Category of the purchased product
- **Quantity** – Number of units purchased
- **Price per Unit** – Price of a single unit of the product
- **Total Amount** – Total transaction amount (Sales revenue)

## 🛠️ Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning** – Handling missing values, data type conversions, and duplicate removal
2. **Descriptive Statistics** – Analyzing mean, median, mode, and standard deviation of sales data
3. **Time Series Analysis** – Identifying sales trends over time
4. **Customer & Product Analysis** – Understanding customer demographics and top-performing products
5. **Data Visualization** – Presenting insights using bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps
6. **Recommendations** – Providing business insights based on EDA findings

## 📈 Key Findings
